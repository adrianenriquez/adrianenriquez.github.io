				<h2>The Process</h2>
				1. Planning - The most important stage, what‚Äôs decided here sets the stage for the entire project. This includes client goals, target audience, detailed feature request and as much relevant information as I can possible gather.
				<br><br>
				2. Design - This is where I will create a wireframe and mockup based on the planning. This is where the visual layout of the website begins to take shape. Then I will send the finished design to the client for review and approval.
				<br><br>
				3. Development - Development involves the bulk of programming work. I will use the most effective technology for best performance.
				<br><br>
				4. Launch - Share your site on social media or in personalized messages to your closest friends, family, or colleagues. Let them know what you‚Äôre up to with this new project.
				<br><br>
				5. Maintain - We keep your project functioning at peak.
