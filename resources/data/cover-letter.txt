Dear  Red Guava,

I'm Adrian Enriquez, a full stack web developer based in Philippines. I am well versed with modern technology in designing and developing excellent web applications. I constantly aim to learn new and various things to accentuate my skills.

As a front-end developer, I create wire-frames and mock-ups. I like converting PSD/mockups to HTML. I put in my superior skills in HTML(5) and CSS(3) to create responsive and pixel perfect design. I am an expert in twitter bootstrap framework, and familiar with other html/css frameworks like Foundation and Polymer. I am proficient in LESS/SCSS, Gulp.js, Grunt, Javascript, jQuery, and Angular.js.

As a back-end developer I am proficient in PHP and love using Laravel as a framework. I am also familiar with Node.js. I also develop REST APIs. I write clean codes using best practices and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

I have good communication skills and deliver high quality work on time. Please see the attached file for my updated resume.
